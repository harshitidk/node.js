# My First Backend Project

Welcome! üëã

This project marks the beginning of my journey into backend development. As a product designer, I've always been passionate about creating great user experiences, and now I'm excited to learn how things work behind the scenes.

## About This Project

- **Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, EJS
- **Purpose:** To learn the basics of backend development, routing, templating, and serving static files.
- **What I've Built:**
  - A simple Express server
  - EJS-powered views
  - A beautiful intro page introducing myself

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. **View in browser:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the intro page.

## Personal Note

This is my very first time working with backend code. I'm learning about:
- Setting up a Node.js project
- Using Express for routing
- Rendering dynamic pages with EJS
- Serving static assets (like my profile image)

I'm excited to keep learning and building more complex backend features as I go!
